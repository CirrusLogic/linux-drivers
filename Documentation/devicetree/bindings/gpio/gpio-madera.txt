Cirrus Logic Madera class audio codecs gpio driver

These codecs have a set of configurable GPIO pins. The bindings here configure
the driver that provides access to these GPIOs.

- the core bindings for the parent MFD driver:
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/madera.txt
- the pinctrl bindings for these codecs
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/cirrus,madera-pinctrl.txt

Required properties:
  - compatible : must be "cirrus,madera-gpio"
  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number. The second cell
    is reserved for future use and must be zero

Optional properties:
  - gpio-line-names : as described in bindings/gpio/gpio.txt

Example:

cs47l85@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l85";

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
};
