Cirrus Logic Tacna class audio codecs multi-function device

These devices are audio SoCs with extensive digital capabilities and a range
of analogue I/O.

See also the child driver bindings in:
bindings/extcon/extcon-tacna.txt
bindings/gpio/gpio-tacna.txt
bindings/regulator/arizona-regulator.txt
bindings/sound/tacna.txt

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of the following chip-specific strings:
        "cirrus,cs47l94"
        "cirrus,cs47l95"

  - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number when
    using SPI.

  - VDD_D-supply : Power supply for the device as defined in
    bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  - VDD_A-supply, VDD_IO1-supply, VDD_IO2-supply,
    VDD1_CP-supply, VDD2_CP-supply, VDD3_CP-supply:
    Power supplies for the device

  - interrupt-controller : Indicates that this device is an interrupt controller

  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to describe an IRQ, must be 2.
    The first cell is the IRQ number.
    The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the /IRQ signal for the device is
    connected to.

  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.

  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number. The second cell
    is reserved for future use and must be zero

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios : One entry specifying the GPIO controlling RESET_B.
    As defined in bindings/gpio.txt.

Optional child nodes:
  - MICBIASx : Initial data for the MICBIAS regulators, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

    One for each MICBIAS generator (MICBIAS1, MICBIAS2, ...)

    One for each output pin (MICBIAS1A, MIBCIAS1B, MICBIAS2A, ...)

    The following property is supported for all nodes:
      - regulator-active-discharge:
	0: Disable active discharge.
	1: Enable active discharge.

    The following following additional property is supported for the generator
    nodes:
      - cirrus,ext-cap : Set to 1 if the MICBIAS has external decoupling
        capacitors attached.

Example:

codec: cs47l94@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l94";
	reg = <0>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	interrupt-parent = <&main_pic>;
	interrupts = <1 0>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	VDD_A-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD_IO1-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD1_CP-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD2_CP-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD3_CP-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD_D-supply = <&regulator_dummy_dcvdd>;

	reset-gpios = <&gpio 0>;

	MICBIAS1 {
		regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
		cirrus,ext-cap = <1>;
	};
};
