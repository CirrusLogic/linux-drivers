Cirrus Logic CLSIC multi-function device

These devices are audio SoCs with extensive digital capabilities and a range
of analogue I/O.

See also the child driver bindings in:
bindings/pinctrl/cirrus,tacna-pinctrl.txt
bindings/regulator/arizona-regulator.txt
bindings/sound/clsic.txt

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "cirrus,clsic"

  - reg : chip select number for SPI.

  - VDD_D-supply : Power supply for the device as defined in
    bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  - VDD_A-supply, VDD_IO1-supply: Power supplies for the device

  - interrupt-controller : Indicates that this device is an interrupt controller

  - #interrupt-cells: the number of cells to describe an IRQ, must be 2.
    The first cell is the IRQ number.
    The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the /IRQ signal for the device is
    connected to.

  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.

  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number. The second cell
    is reserved for future use and must be zero

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios : One entry specifying the GPIO controlling RESET_B.
    As defined in bindings/gpio.txt.

  - pinctrl-names : Name of pinctrl configurations. Each of these is optional.
    Legal names are:
	"probe" - external pinctrl dependencies required to probe this codec,
		typically these are for the reset GPIO and IRQ pin, though
		could include clocks. Do NOT include configuration of this
		codec's own GPIO pins because these can't be applied until
		after the mfd probe has completed.

	"active" - full set of external and local pinctrl configurations to
		apply after probe including all the configuration of the GPIO
		pins on this codec (bindings/pinctrl/cirrus,tacna-pinctrl.txt).
		This must include the external dependencies in the "probe"
		configuration, since they will still be required after probe.

    Do not use "default" since it is applied too early before the mfd has
    fully probed the codec.

  - pinctrl-0 : handle to pinctrl configurations matching the entries in
    pinctrl-names

  - volatile_memory : Bool defining system without flash memory

  - spi-pad-bits : The pad_bits of the regmap created by the SPI bus driver is
    set to a default of 32, this property allows that value to be adjusted to
    support different CLSIC devices that may require a pad_bits of 16.

  - spi-max-pages : Maximum number of pages (PAGE_SIZE) that can be transferred
    at once by spi bus. Without this property the driver will set the maximum
    size to be (32 X 1024) bytes.

  - MICBIAS1x : Initial data for the MICBIAS regulators, as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

    One for each output pin (MICBIAS1A, MIBCIAS1B, MICBIAS1C, MICBIAS1D)

    The following property is supported for all nodes:
      - regulator-active-discharge:
        0: Disable active discharge.
        1: Enable active discharge.

Example:

codec: cs48lx50@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,clsic";
	reg = <0>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	interrupts = <13 8>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;

	reset-gpio = <&gpio 0>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	VDD_A-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD_IO1-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;
	VDD_D-supply = <&regulator_dummy>;

	pinctrl-names = "active";
	pinctrl-0 = <&cs48lx50_defaults>;

	cs48lx50_pinctrl: tacna-pinctrl {
		compatible = "cirrus,tacna-pinctrl";

		cs48lx50_defaults: defaults {
			asp1 {
				groups = "asp1";
				function = "asp1";
				bias-bus-hold;
			};
			asp2 {
				groups = "asp2";
				function = "asp2";
				bias-bus-hold;
			};
			in3-pdm {
				groups = "in3-pdm";
				function ="in3-pdm";
				bias-bus-hold;
			};
			in4-pdm {
				groups = "in4-pdm";
				function ="in4-pdm";
				bias-bus-hold;
			};
		};
	};

	MICBIAS1A {
		regulator-active-discharge = <1>;
	};
};
