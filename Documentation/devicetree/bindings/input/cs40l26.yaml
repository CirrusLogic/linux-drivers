  svc-le:
    description:
      Range of LE values, defined by "cirrus,min" and "cirrus,max" in Henries
      using Q0.23 number format, that determines which SVC and Wavetable tuning
      files should be loaded by the driver. The files must be named
      "cs40l26-svcX.bin" for SVC tunings and "cs40l26-wtX.bin" for wavetables,
      where 'X' corresponds to the value given to "cirrus,index".
      The optional property "cirrus,gain-adjust" is used to alter the global
      digital gain based on which LRA is being used. This value has a range of
      -100 to +100 and will change the digital gain percentage by this amount.
      Note that the full gain value must still be valid, the maximum is 100% and
      the minimum is 0%.
      If the LE value found for the attached LRA does not match a provided
      range, or if these properties are omitted/malformed, the default tunings
      ("cs40l26-svc.bin" and "cs40l26.bin") will be loaded.
      See examples section for how to use these controls.

  cirrus,vibe-state:
    description:
      Enable the driver to report the device's state: Active [3], Standby [2],
      Shutdown [1], Hibernate [0]. This can only be enabled for firmware types
      which support the "CP_TRIGGER" DSP to host mailbox message.

      If this control is present, vibe_state tracking is enabled and the driver
      will report the current state via the "vibe_state" sysfs control.
      (Default) Disabled
    type: boolean

  cirrus,bst-expl-mode-disable:
    description:
      Disable boost exploratory mode if this boolean is present in the
      devicetree. Boost exploratory mode allows the device to overshoot
      the set peak current limit. This has potential to damage the boost
      inductor. Disabling this mode will prevent this from happening; it will
      also prevent the device from detecting boost inductor short errors.
