      In exploratory mode the analog maximum peak current limit of 4.5 A
      (tolerance of + 160 mA) will be applied. This is required for the
      device to successfully detect a boost inductor short.

      Boost exploratory mode allows the device to overshoot the set boost peak
      current limit (i.e. if current peak limit is set to 2.5 A to protect the
      boost inductor, the current limit will be opened up to 4.5 A for
      several milliseconds at boost startup).
      This has potential to damage the boost inductor.

      Disabling this mode will prevent this from happening; it will also
      prevent the device from detecting boost inductor short errors.

      DC input watchdog response. Configures the response of
      the amplifier hardware path when an error condition has
      been detected. If this property is present and the DC
      watchdog has been enabled, the device will mute digital
      PCM volume upon the watchdog event being triggered.
