      "cs40l26-svcX.bin" for SVC tunings and "cs40l26-wtX.bin" for wavetables,
      where 'X' corresponds to the value given to "cirrus,index".
      The optional property "cirrus,gain-adjust" is used to alter the global
      digital gain based on which LRA is being used. This value has a range of
      -100 to +100 and will change the digital gain percentage by this amount.
      Note that the full gain value must still be valid, the maximum is 100% and
      the minimum is 0%.
      If the LE value found for the attached LRA does not match a provided
      range, or if these properties are omitted/malformed, the default tunings
      ("cs40l26-svc.bin" and "cs40l26.bin") will be loaded.
