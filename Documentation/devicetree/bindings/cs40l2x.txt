CS40L20 Boosted Haptics Driver

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of "cirrus,cs40l20", "cirrus,cs40l25", "cirrus,cs40l25a"
    or "cirrus,cs40l25b".

  - reg : The I2C slave address of the device.

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : Regulators for the device's VA and VP supplies,
    respectively. See the following:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  - cirrus,boost-ind-nanohenry : Boost inductor value, expressed in nH. Valid
    values include 1000, 1200, 1500 and 2200.

  - cirrus,boost-cap-microfarad : Total equivalent boost capacitance on the VBST
    and VAMP pins, derated at 11 volts DC. The value must be rounded to the
    nearest integer and expressed in uF.

  - cirrus,boost-ipk-milliamp : Boost inductor peak current, expressed in mA.
    Valid values range from 1600 to 4500 (inclusive) in steps of 50.

Optional properties:

  - reset-gpios : GPIO used for resetting the device.

  - cirrus,refclk-gpio2 : Boolean for configuring the device to expect its
    32.768-kHz reference clock on the REFCLK/GPIO2 pin. If this property is
    omitted, the device expects its 32.768-kHz reference clock on the
    ASP_BCLK/REFCLK pin. This property is ignored for CS40L25A and CS40L25B
    devices as reference clock selection is configured automatically.

Example:

  cs40l20: cs40l20@43 {
    compatible = "cirrus,cs40l20";
    reg = <0x43>;
    reset-gpios = <&gpio0 54 0>;
    VA-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
    VP-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
    cirrus,boost-ind-nanohenry = <1000>;
    cirrus,boost-cap-microfarad = <4>;
    cirrus,boost-ipk-milliamp = <4500>;
    cirrus,refclk-gpio2;
  };
