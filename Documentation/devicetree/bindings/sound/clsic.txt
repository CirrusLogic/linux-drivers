Cirrus Logic CLSIC multi-function device

This describes audio configuration bindings for these codecs.

See also the core bindings for the parent MFD driver:
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/clsic.txt

These properties are all contained in the parent MFD node.

Optional properties:
  - host_controls_dsp2 : CLSIC devices may permit the second Halo Core to
  be used as a general purpose audio DSP and delegate all control to the host.
  In this case the Halo Core is managed as a DSP using the Cirrus Logic Tacna
  audio infrastructure.

Example:

cs48lx50@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,clsic";

	host_controls_dsp2;
};
