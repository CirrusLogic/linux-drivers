CS35L45 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l45"

  - reg : the SPI chip select line or I2C device address for the device

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

  - interrupts : IRQ line info CS35L45.
    (See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
    for further information relating to interrupt properties)

Optional properties:
  - reset-gpios : gpio used to reset the amplifier

Optional GPIOX Sub-nodes:

  Details found in section 4.23

  The cs35l45 node can have up to three "cirrus,gpio-ctrlX" ('X' = [1,2,3])
  sub-nodes for configuring the GPIO pins.

  - gpio-dir : GPIO pin direction. Valid only when 'gpio-ctrl'
    is 1.

    0 = Output
    1 = Input (Default)

  - gpio-lvl : GPIO level. Valid only when 'gpio-ctrl' is 1 and 'gpio-dir' is 0.

    0 = Low (Default)
    1 = High

  - gpio-op-cfg : GPIO output configuration. Valid only when 'gpio-ctrl' is 1
    and 'gpio-dir' is 0.

    0 = CMOS (Default)
    1 = Open Drain

  - gpio-pol : GPIO output polarity select. Valid only when 'gpio-ctrl' is 1
    and 'gpio-dir' is 0.

    0 = Non-inverted, Active High (Default)
    1 = Inverted, Active Low

  - gpio-invert : Defines the polarity of the GPIO pin if configured
    as input.

    0 = Not inverted (Default)
    1 = Inverted

  - gpio-ctrl : Defines the function of the GPIO pin.

  GPIO1:
    0 = High impedance input (Default)
    1 = Pin acts as a GPIO, direction controlled by 'gpio-dir'
    2 = Pin acts as MDSYNC, direction controlled by MDSYNC
    3-7 = Reserved

  GPIO2:
    0 = High impedance input (Default)
    1 = Pin acts as a GPIO, direction controlled by 'gpio-dir'
    2 = Pin acts as open drain INT
    3 = Reserved
    4 = Pin acts as push-pull output INT. Active low.
    5 = Pin acts as push-pull output INT. Active high.
    6,7 = Reserved

  GPIO3:
    0 = High impedance input (Default)
    1 = Pin acts as a GPIO, direction controlled by 'gpio-dir'
    2-7 = Reserved

Example:

cs35l45: cs35l45@2 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l45";
	reg = <2>;
	VA-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
	VP-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio0 54 0>;

	cirrus,gpio-ctrl2 {
		gpio-ctrl = <0x02>;
	};
};
