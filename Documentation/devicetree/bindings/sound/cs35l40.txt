CS35L40 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l40"

  - reg : the SPI chip select line for the device

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:
  - cirrus,sclk-force-output : Audio serial port SCLK force
  output control. Forces the SCLK to continue to drive even
  if no ASP_TXn channels are enabled.

  - cirrus,lrclk-force-output : Audio serial port LRCLK force
  output control. Forces the LRCLK to continue to drive even
  if no ASP_TXn channels are enabled.

  - cirrus,right-channel-amp : Boolean to determine which channel
  the amplifier is to receive the audio data on. If present the
  amplifier receives data on the right channel of I2S data.
  If not present the amplifier receives data on the left
  channel of I2S data

Example:

cs35l40: cs35l40@2 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs35l40";
	reg = <2>;
	VA-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
	VP-supply = <&dummy_vreg>;
};
