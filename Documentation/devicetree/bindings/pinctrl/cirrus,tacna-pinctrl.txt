Cirrus Logic Tacna class audio codecs pinctrl driver

The Cirrus Logic Tacna codecs provide a number of GPIO functions for
interfacing to external hardware and to provide logic outputs to other devices.
Certain groups of GPIO pins also have an alternate function, normally as an
audio interface.

The set of available GPIOs, functions and alternate function groups differs
between codecs so refer to the datasheet for the codec for further information
on what is supported on that device.

The properties for this driver must exist within the parent MFD driver node.
See bindings/mfd/tacna.txt.

Required properties of configuration subnodes:
  - groups : name of one pin group to configure. One of:
        asp2, asp3, asp4, dsd1, in1-pdm, in2-pdm, in3-pdm, in4-pdm, out5-pdm,
        gpio1, gpio2, ..., gpio23
    The gpioN groups select the single pin of this name for configuration

Optional properties of configuration subnodes:
  Any configuration option not explicitly listed in the dts will be left at
  chip default setting.

  - function : name of function to assign to this group. One of (actual
    available will differ from codec to codec, refer to the datasheet for
    more information):
        asp1, asp2, asp3, asp4, asp1ao, dsd1, in1-pdm, in2-pdm, in3-pdm,

  - bias-disable : disable pull-up and pull-down
  - bias-bus-hold : enable buskeeper
  - bias-pull-up : output is pulled-up
  - bias-pull-down : output is pulled-down
  - drive-push-pull : CMOS output
  - drive-open-drain : open-drain output
  - drive-strength : drive strength in mA. See the datasheet for a list of valid
  values for your codec.
  - output-low : set the pin to output mode with low level
  - output-high : set the pin to output mode with high level

Example:

codec: cs47l96@0 {
	compatible = "cirrus,cs47l96";

	pinctrl-names = "active";
	pinctrl-0 = <&cs47l96_gpio_config>;

	cs47l96_gpio_config: cs47l96-gpio-config {
		asp2 {
			groups = "asp2";
			function = "asp2";
			bias-bus-hold;
		};

		opclk {
			groups = "gpio1";
			function = "opclk";
			bias-pull-up;
			drive-strength = <8>;
		};
	};
};
